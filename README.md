- 👋 Hi, I’m @loudy-art a multidisciplinary artist dedicated to movement, rythm and software. I will always say, that i'm led by curiosity, at first, i don't do any of my main activities because they can give me a job, money or status, i do them because i want to really understand what's behind them. If we take coding for example, i started because i spent most of my time in front of a computer, i had my first e-mail address when i was 7 years old, and was playing some old windows videogames on my computer too. But as i was growing up, i always had this idea on my mind like "why the hell this button does what it does?" so that's when it all begins, and that's how i discovered coding.
